<h1>This is a formal guid to origami from an axiomatic foundation</h1>
<p>The aim of this website is to show that axiomatic mathematics can be applied (AND ENJOYED!!!!) in every day activities </p>

<h2>The Huzita-Hatori axioms</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Given 2 distinct points p1 and p2, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.</li>
    <li>Given two distinct points p1 and p2, there is a unique fold that places p1 onto p2.</li>
    <li>Given two lines l1 and l2, there is a fold that places l1 onto l2.</li>
    <li>Given a point p1 and a line l1, there is a unique fold perpendicular to l1 that passes through point p1.</li>
    <li>Given two points p1 and p2 and a line l1, there is a fold that places p1 onto l1 and passes through p2.</li>
    <li>Given two points p1 and p2 and two lines l1 and l2, there is a fold that places p1 onto l1 and p2 onto l2.</li>
    <li>Given one point p and two lines l1 and l2, there is a fold that places p onto l1 and is perpendicular to l2.</li>
